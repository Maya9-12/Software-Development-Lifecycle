# Software-Development-Lifecycle

The most important asset to take into consideration when creating a product for a client is the clientsâ€™ needs. The clients' needs are prioritized from most important to least to ensure that the most important items are delivered first. User stories help in meeting these needs by setting clear objectives for the team and allowing them to break down large tasks so as to focus on problems individually. Before beginning the development of a program, a considerable amount of time is spent on planning which gives the team a clear understanding of what is needed to create a successful product. I believe Scrum is one of most beneficial and effective agile processes for developmental work. Scrum allows for a quicker release of high-quality products while also being cost effective and flexible. Scrum also promotes teamwork and collaboration, in turn, increasing readiness, respect and responsibility throughout a team and its members.
